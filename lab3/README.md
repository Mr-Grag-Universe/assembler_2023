## String Processing

This is most annoying and hard lab in this repository.
This program gets strings while ^D has not been pressed. Than it transorm each string by cutting each word,
that doesn't start with the first letter of the first word in this string. So in this way in the result strings
there is only words starting with the same letter (first letter in the string).
Also this program cares about separaters in the result string and them all changed to the single spaces (' ').

Result strings are saved to the file, which name passed as an environment variable "ofn".
