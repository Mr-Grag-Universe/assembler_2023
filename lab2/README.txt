This lab is about heap-sort algorithm for matrix.
I needed to sort it's columns by their maximums, so there is also algorithm for maximum searching
Also you can build to versions of this program passing diffrent types of "order" flags to make
> make order=forward
or
> make order=backward
or it's possible to pass nothing and in this case you'll build app like in the first (default) case
