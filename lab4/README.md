## Ð¡alculating a function by decomposing it into a series

Here I've been learning to make a deale with FPU and libc functions like fprintf, math functions, fopen and etc. 
This program can calculate arctg(x) with |x| <= 1 with passed precision.
Also it saves members of the series to the file, which name you pass through command line params like this:
> ./lab out.txt

PS: set your own version of gcc in the Makefile. And also check other pathes in it.
